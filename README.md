# Résumé 

### About
This is a simple resume made with HTML, CSS, JS using JSON data.
Hover over each item in the "_Programming Languages_" section to view my experience in each language.  

HTML is used for making the initial block structure of the page with some simple data, CSS is used for giving some style to the page, and JS is used to create small UI components dynamically and fill the data into the page. All the data about details related to the user is stored as a JSON object in a JS file.
